# Tugas Besar IF3270 Pembelajaran Mesin

## What's this?
This repository contains the implementation of a neural network framework for the Machine Learning course (IF3270). It includes a backend built with Flask for managing neural network operations such as training, weight initialization, and graph export/import, and a Vue 3-based frontend for visualizing and interacting with the neural network structure. The project supports customizable layers, activation functions, and training parameters, making it a versatile tool for experimenting with neural network architectures and learning processes.

## woah, so... how do i setup and run the program?
as easy as it is, you only need to make sure that you have installed python and then run:
```
pip install flask flask-cors numpy matplotlib tqdm pydantic
```

and then, you can run our program by doing:
1. open a terminal
2. insert to the terminal
```
python app.py
```
3. open another terminal
4. insert
```
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## okay that's cool, but now... who makes all this programs?

to make all of this, a person's might is not enough, so this is what we did
